    "#2. For each point we update the max number of point count\n",
    "#3. Points might be vertical, in which case calculating the slope would throw divisionbyzero exception.\n",
    "#thus, we need keep a separate count of vertical points\n",
    "#4. Points being horizontal has a special case.\n",
    "#becuase we are using gcd to calculate largest common divider. Notice gcd(a,0) = |a|\n",
